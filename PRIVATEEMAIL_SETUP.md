# PrivateEmail SMTP Configuration Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you configure your email service to work with PrivateEmail (Namecheap's email service) to resolve the 504 Gateway Timeout error you're experiencing.

## PrivateEmail SMTP Settings

### Recommended Configuration:

- **Security:** TLS/STARTTLS (recommended) or SSL
- **Authentication:** Required
- **Username:** Your full email address (e.g., `yourname@yourdomain.com`)
- **Password:** Your PrivateEmail account password

### Alternative Configuration (if mail.privateemail.com doesn't work):
- **SMTP Server:** `smtp.privateemail.com`
- **Port:** `587` (TLS/STARTTLS) or `465` (SSL)
- **Security:** TLS/STARTTLS (recommended) or SSL

## Step-by-Step Configuration

### 1. Access Your Project Settings
1. Go to your project dashboard
2. Click on "Project Settings" or the settings icon
3. Navigate to "SMTP Settings"

### 2. Configure SMTP Settings
Enter the following values in your SMTP settings form:

```
Host: mail.privateemail.com
Port: 587
Secure: false (for TLS/STARTTLS) or true (for SSL on port 465)
Username: your-email@yourdomain.com
Password: your-privateemail-password
```

### 3. Test Your Configuration

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 504 Gateway Timeout Error
This error typically occurs due to:
1. **Incorrect SMTP server settings**
2. **Network connectivity issues**
3. **Authentication problems**
4. **Server timeout configurations**

### Solutions:

#### 1. Verify SMTP Settings
- Double-check your SMTP server hostname
- Ensure the port is correct (587 for TLS, 465 for SSL)
- Verify your username is your full email address
- Confirm your password is correct

#### 2. Try Alternative Ports
If port 587 doesn't work, try:
- Port 465 with SSL enabled
- Port 25 (if not blocked by your hosting provider)

#### 3. Check Authentication
- Ensure your PrivateEmail account is active
- Verify you're using the correct email address as username
- Check if your password contains special characters that need escaping

#### 4. Network Issues
- Test if you can reach `mail.privateemail.com` from your server
- Check if your hosting provider blocks outbound SMTP connections
- Verify firewall settings

## Advanced Configuration

### For SSL (Port 465):
```
Host: mail.privateemail.com
Port: 465
